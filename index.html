            <h1><b>Hey there.</b></h1>
            <p><b>My name is Tazneem Davids and welcome to my personal webpage! I am a 23 year old artist, web designer and graphic designer wannabe (LOL), and am currently a web development student at Hyperion Dev. If you asked me what I'm most passionate about, I would say art 100%. I have had a love for creating and design from a very young age. It's pretty much what defines me as a person, an artist and someone who appreciates art in every shape and form. Be it painting, drawing, music, movies, animation, poetry, I love it all. Whats so amazing about art is that you have complete control of what you create, you can make things happen that seem impossible in the real world, it's just an amazing thing that one can only be greatful to have a passion for. It is my love for art that inspires me to create and constantly gives me ideas. It really gives you a diferent perspective on everything you see around you, you start to realise just how beautiful everything really is. I have always been very uncertain, as we all are when we're young, about that classic question, where do you see yourself in 5 years? I kind of still am, I mean no one knows what lies ahead, but we can always hope and have faith things will work out for the better. So my hopes for the future would be stability and success. Basically comfort in knowing I am finally doing something that I will grow and succeed in, and it will only get better with time. I dream of finding that job that provides a good life for me, that I can share with my family and thrive in. I created this webpage using the following languages and tools:</b></p>

                <h1><b>What am I good at?</b></h1>
                <p>I am constantly sketching, painting and designing, I would definitely say it is my greatest strength. I have worked a lot throughout my school years with microsoft, be it word, powerpoint etc, and it really helped me to understand PCs well, even while I was interning, I had a lot of tasks, most of which would involve working on a PC. So I would say I have a good working knowledge of computers up to this point (Windows and even a little bit of Mac). Because of my first and unfortunately, my only year of Visual Communication Design, I became accustomed to using Adobe Illustrator, and even created a few projects with it in the past, I found it quite enjoyable. I am also currently learning to code and after 2 months I have become a bit familiar with designing using HTML and CSS, of course I have a lot to learn about it, but the basics I know are pretty useful and I have even created a simple online store (you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/Tasneem-Davids/gitTask1" style="color: rgb(33, 206, 206);"><b>here</b></a> on my Github), as well as this webpage, using these languages along with Bootstrap.</p>

                <h1><b>My education and work experience.</b></h1>
                <p>After matriculating from Pelican Park High School in 2015, I decided to take a gap year and work as an extra with my aunt for a while, which involved a lot of early mornings and late nights. It took me some time to decide what I wanted to study and how I could incorparate my love for art into the field I would pursue, and later I decided I would study Visual Communication Design at the <a href="https://www.cput.ac.za/" style="text-decoration: none;">Cape Peninsula University of Technology</a>. I successfully completed my first year, but couldn't complete the rest of the three year course due to financial reasons. This lead to me interning at <a href="https://www.highburymedia.co.za/" style="text-decoration: none;">Highbury Media</a> for a couple months in thier HR department as well reception, but unfotunately the company relocated and I was forced to leave because of transportation. I found it so hard to find another job and decided I would have to study again, and after do research for so long , I came across the 6 month bootcamp that I am currently taking with <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Hyperion Dev.</a> </p>
